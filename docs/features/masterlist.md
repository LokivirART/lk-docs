# Masterlist

The masterlist displays every [character](characters.md) that exists on the site, based on the character's visibility settings. It provides a number of search and sorting features, as well as a toggle between grid and list views. The character masterlist is essentially the same as the MYO slot masterlist, with a few differences that will be noted below.

## Display

Characters that are listed as visible to the public are listed on the masterlist page, which is paginated. Users with the **Manage Masterlist** [power](user-ranks.md) will additionally see characters that are not visible, marked with an eye icon in front of the character's code.

By default, the masterlist is shown in **grid mode** - all characters will be displayed as their thumbnails, listing their character code (if a character), name (if assigned by the user, or is a MYO slot), species, rarity and owner.

In **list mode**, characters are listed without images, in table form, showing the information above as well as the character's date of creation.

The grey buttons under the search button can be clicked to switch between modes. This preference is remembered by your Internet browser and will persist if you use the same browser to access the page again.

## Searching

The following search conditions can be set:

- Character name (user-assigned) OR character code
- [Rarity](rarities.md)
- [Species](species.md)
- Category
- Owner name
- [Artist name](character-images.md)
- [Designer name](character-images.md)
- Owner URL/alias
- Artist URL/alias
- Designer URL/alias
- Minimum resale price
- Maximum resale price
- Trading status (user-assigned)
- Gift art status (user-assigned)
- Gift writing status (user-assigned)
- Can be resold
- Can be traded
- Can be gifted
- [Trait](traits.md) selection (AND selection)

Additionally, an option to search through all character images, including ones that are no longer valid, can be toggled for the options shown in red. Only images visible to the user will be searched.

The MYO slot masterlist presents the same search options except for the category selection.

## Sorting

The following sort orders can be specified:

- Newest first (default)
- Oldest first
- Highest sale value
- Lowest sale value

Note that "newest" and "oldest" are dependent on characters and are not influenced by character images. Additionally, characters that cannot be resold have a default value of $0 and will appear at the front of the list.
