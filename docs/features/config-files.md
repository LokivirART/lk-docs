# Config Files

The configuration files are files in the siteâ€™s code that allow customisation of certain features that are highly unlikely to be changed on a regular basis.

## Usage

These files are located in `config/lorekeeper`. The `settings.php` file is the only file that may require any editing at all; the others should not be touched except when coding new features.

## Files

### settings.php

This file lists some basic site settings that are unlikely to change once the site is in use, and therefore should be modified before all else. The following properties can be modified here:

- Site Name
- Character Codes (formatting)
- Masterlist Thumbnail Dimensions
- Trade Asset Limit

Please refer to the comments in the file itself for a complete description of each setting.
