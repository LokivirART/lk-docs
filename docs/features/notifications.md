# Notifications

Logged in [users](user-accounts.md) have a notifications page, which lists notifications for important events that may require their attention.

## Usage

Notifications include any pertinent links, as well as a timestamp for when the event occurred.

New notifications are displayed as a counter in the navigation bar, which goes away once the notifications page is viewed. New notifications are highlighted with a differently-coloured background when viewed at this time.

Notifications can be cleared individually by clicking the x on the right of the notification, or by clicking the clear all button to remove all existing notifications.
