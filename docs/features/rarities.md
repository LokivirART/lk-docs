# Rarities

Rarities are a characteristic that is assigned to both [traits](traits.md) and [characters](characters.md). They can be edited in the admin panel by users with the **Edit World Data** [power](user-ranks.md).

## Usage

Rarities are assigned to characters and traits upon creation. Staff can cap the maximum rarity of selectable traits for a MYO slot by selecting a rarity during MYO slot creation, but the rarity of a character is otherwise not strictly linked to its traits.

Traits and characters can be filtered by rarity on the world page and masterlist pages respectively.

## Editing

Rarities have the following properties:

- Name
- Colour (hexadecimal code)
- World Page Image
- Description (accepts HTML)

**Name** is the rarity's name.

**Colour** is colour used to represent this rarity. It is used to colour the rarity's name as a visual aid.

The **World Page Image** is shown in the encyclopedia, and nowhere else. As with all encyclopedia images, the recommended size is 200 x 200 pixels, but can be any size.

**Description** is a description of the rarity for the encyclopedia page.

Additionally, the hierarchy of rarities can be edited from the Rarities index page. This order affects the display order on the encyclopedia page, and which rarities are considered rarer than others.
