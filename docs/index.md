Lorekeeper is an open-source framework for managing ARPGs/closed species masterlists built using the Laravel framework. In simple terms - you will be able to make a copy of the site, perform setup/enter data about your species and game, and it'll provide you with the automation to keep track of your species, players and ARPG submissions.

Lorekeeper is free and open-source, which means it's free for you to use and modify to your needs. Please see the tutorials below for instructions on setting up!
